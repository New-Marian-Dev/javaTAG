Debug Building: Your Office
You look at your watch, even though you have known that it stopped several hours ago.
You do it more as a gesture to make it seem like you're on top of things and have a schedule to follow.
Instead you know better. You have been putting off typing up and filing any bug reports this morning.
With a half-hearted sigh to yourself, you make your way back to your office. As you sit down at your old, synthetic wood desk you fire up the old style terminal that sits before you.
You stare at the strings of text as it boots up from it's deep slumber, slowly drifting off into your own world of thought outside of reality.

Snapping back to reality as the computer roars to life.
